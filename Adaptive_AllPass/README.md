# Adaptive All-Pass Filter
 Time-varying delay estimation using an adaptive all-pass filters

Using an all-pass filter we estimate a per sample time delay between two signals

- _Adaptive_AllPass_ estimates a single (time-varying) delay between two channels using an adaptive all-pass filter
   - Provides both the adaptive all-pass (AAP) filter and the normalised adaptive all-pass (NAAP) filter

- _Adaptive_Delay_Est_ allows comparison of the NAAP filter with the algorithms provided by Sun1999 and So1994, using the data generated in _Signal_Generation_
